This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is my first attempt at creating a portfolio website using React. I hope it can provide a good starting point for others who are wanting to create a website to host their projects. Refinements will be made before I publish this website using GitHub Pages.

To view the website:

1) Download the Zip file
2) Open the zip file and extract the project folder to your desired location.
3) Open your preferred code editor program (Visual Studio Code is a personal favourite).
4) Use your code editor to navigate to the project directory (location of extracted folder) by opening the folder directly or using the terminal and 'cd' command
5) Once navigated to the project directory, type 'npm start' in your code editor's terminal and press enter 

The website should open up in your web broswer with the address 'http://localhost:3000'

Happy coding!
